# IT265 Final Game Design Document

---
Change Log:

Mana: changed it so that you can summon any amount of monsters per turn so long as you have the mana. This was done to make the game faster paced.

Added movement system along with front line and backline: These mechanics were added to give more importance to where your place your monsters.

Health pool: changed total health value from 50 to 30, games were taking too long during testing with 50 health





Title:

Duel or Die

Players are forced into a duel they can't refuse by a mysterious entity. If they refuse, they'll automatically die.

Game Setting:

Setting is fantasy to allow for a wide range of creatures and monsters to be used as cards. Fantasy in the sense that magical creatures and things of that nature exist, but set in more modern times as opposed to medieval.

Game Characters:

There are three main characters, the two players that are dueling, and the mysterious entity that has beckoned them. The entity has no body, only speaking to the players through their minds when it needs to.

Game Theme:

Game is set in modern times (year 20xx). Fantasy elements are involved to allow for a wider range of idea to be implemented.

Game Story:

Players are mysteriously beckoned by a strange voice in their minds to an abandoned building. When they arrived, the doors are locked shut, and the scene around them transforms into a dueling stadium, in which they must fight to win. If players refuse to duel, they automatically die.

Objectives and Conflicts:

Each player will build a deck with cards of their choosing to use in the duel. Players will have to plan around the entity cards that they will have to draw every 3rd turn. The goal of the duel is to reduce the opponents health to zero to win. Cards will include monsters and creatures with which to do damage, and support cards to aid the player.

Game Mechanics:

Coin toss: Players will flip a coin to determine who goes first.

Health points: The primary objective of the game. Players will need to watch their health points and their opponents to formulate a victory plan.

Mana/magic points: These are consumed when activating card effects. Players will begin with a set amount each game. I've implemented this to somewhat limit longer card combos.

Match Timer: Players will each have a limited amount of time they are allowed to act for. If they go over the time limit on their turn, they automtically lose.

Summoning: Players will be able to summon 1 monster normally per turn. Some monsters may have conditions that must be met before that can be summoned.

Enity cards: Players will have to draw an entity card on every third turn of the battle. This is to keep an element of surprise to the game. Entity cards will not be too heavily detrimental to avoid the feeling of thinking you lost due to bad luck.

Card updates: Cards will be updated further into the game's lifespan to ensure players favorite creatures are still usable in future landscapes of the game.


Target audience analysis:

Target audience: Players who enjoy games with deck building mechanics, most likely ages 10 and up, as earlier ages may have a bit of trouble understanding the game, although it isn't too complicated.

Players who enjoy managing resources (health, mana)

Casual players who like not getting too into things

Competitive players that like to be the best at each game they play

The game will be easy to pick up and enjoy, with the possiblity of crafting strong decks for people who want to make it competitive.

Accessibility and inclusivity strategies:

The game will have a wide range of viable strategies, i.e summoning multiple monsters to attack and deal damage, or setting up your board to summon one more powerful monster. There will be a range of different monsters to appeal to a wider audience, i.e ogres, fairies, elves, etc. Cards will be carefully balanced using the mana mechanic and other mechanics to ensure no one strategy is definitively better than the rest.

Pitch preparation:

Duel or Die is a one on one, turn based deck building game in which players must duel to the death. Players will utilize decks they have built themselves utulizing a wide range of cards to reduce their opponents health to zero. Players must also play around "Entity cards" cards that are drawn every third turn with negative effects.


External feedback:

Brother:

Thought mechanics and concept were solid, emphasized that setting should be more thoroughly defined, such as maybe choosing a specific city or location.

Reflection: I'll try my best to come up with a location that I would potentially like to do.


Friend:

Enjoyed the idea of cards being patched in the future, emphasized that cards should be carfully designed so that no one strategy is dominant. Also wanted a more detailed setting.

Reflection: As stated earlier I'll try my best to think of a specific location. I will also put extensive thought into card design.


Friend:

Enjoyed the idea of a mana bar to limit longer card combos. Emphasized that card effects should not be too overpowered.

Reflection: As stated earlier I'll try my best to think of a specific location, and will also put extensive thought into card design.
