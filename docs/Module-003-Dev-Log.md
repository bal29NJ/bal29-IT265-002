 Example Template (include the brackets to make a checklist, fill them in as appropriate
- [x] Goal 1: Complete discussion
- [x] Goal 2: Learn more about game mechanics
- [x] Goal 3: Learn about color theory
-->

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - <Learned about color theory and what could possibly make a game "bad" or unfun>
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.
  -  <Couldn't think about what games I considered bad for a little bit>
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.
  -  <I went through my games library and picked a few.>

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
-  <I leanred a but about color theory and how different colors signify different things.

#### Free Thinking
- Brainstorm or reflect on design ideas, architecture patterns, or potential improvements.

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
